# HAPPI (basic)
This repository hosts the base version of the Happi model, developed using Mathematica software. The Happi model is a computational tool designed for exploring the low-carbon transition of the power system.

**Contents**

    Model Code: The primary model code is available in the file HAPPI_vJune2021.nb, written in the Mathematica programming language.

    Data Files:
        slices.dat: This model uses 64 times slices to represent various wind and solar variabilities and electricity demand. This file describe how many hours in each slice.
        solarWindDemand.dat: capacity factors for solar and wind.

    Model Description: A detailed description of the model is provided in the document ODD-model description_0617.docx in this repository.

    Research Papers: This model has been the basis for three research papers:
